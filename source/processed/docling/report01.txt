The scope includes, but is not limited to:

- Definition and standardization of data formats, metadata, and documentation;
- Implementation of quality control protocols, versioning strategies, and data access policies;
- Curation of raw and processed data collected from sensors, flux towers, meteorological stations, and laboratory analyses;
- Integration of metadata schemas and alignment with international standards (e.g., CF conventions, ARM/INPE protocols);
- Support for compliance with FAIR principles, enhancing data reuse and interoperability within global research networks.

This document is critical to ensuring that all datasets produced under AmazonFACE are curated in a consistent and transparent manner, enabling robust scientific analysis and future replication of research findings.

## 2 Data

## 2.1 Data Types

The AmazonFACE project generates a wide variety of data types that reflect the complexity of ecosystem-scale experiments in tropical forest environments. These datasets originate from multiple sources and sensors, covering atmospheric, biological, physical, and chemical domains.

The main data types include:

AmazonFACE investigates the impact of elevated atmospheric CO 2 on tropical forest ecosystems, generating complex datasets that require careful documentation and long-term preservation.

Each data type has specific curation needs and quality control procedures, which are addressed in later sections of this report.

- Atmospheric Data: Measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, solar radiation, and CO 2 concentrations collected via meteorological towers and sensor arrays.
- Gas Exchange and Physiological Data: Leaf-level and canopy-level measurements of gas exchange, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and respiration under controlled CO 2 enrichment.
- Flux Data: Eddy covariance data providing high-frequency measurements of energy, water vapor, and carbon fluxes between the forest canopy and the atmosphere.
- Soil and Hydrological Data: Soil moisture, temperature profiles, water table depth, and infiltration rates, collected using soil probes, lysimeters, and piezometers.
- Remote Sensing and Imaging: UAV imagery, hemispherical photography, and satellite-derived vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI) used for monitoring forest structure and phenology.
- Vegetation and Structural Data: Forest inventory data including species identification, tree diameter, height, biomass estimates, and leaf area index (LAI).
- Metadata and Ancillary Data: Instrument logs, deployment metadata, calibration files, maintenance records, and campaign notes necessary for data interpretation and validation.

This diversity of data types requires standardized documentation practices and interoperable formats to ensure usability by a wide scientific audience.

## 2.2 Instruments and Platforms

The AmazonFACE project employs a wide array of instruments and observational platforms to monitor the effects of elevated atmospheric CO 2 on tropical forest ecosystems. These instruments operate continuously or in campaigns across multiple spatial and temporal scales.

A standardized classification system is used to identify each device through instrument codes (e.g., EQ001-EQ018). For each instrument, metadata are recorded describing its purpose, variables monitored, physical units, and standard names

Each instrument type is associated with metadata describing its model, serial number, location, deployment dates, calibration procedures, and maintenance history.

following ARM and CF conventions to promote interoperability and data reuse. The core instrument types include:

- Meteorological Towers: Include instruments such as the Barometer PTB101B (EQ004), Ultrasonic Anemometer WMT700 (EQ006), Thermohygrometer HC2S3 (EQ007), and Sunshine Pyranometer SPN1 (EQ003). These sensors measure air temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind vectors, and radiation fluxes.
- Soil Sensor Arrays: Include the Profile Probe PR2/6 (EQ016) and Soil CO 2 Flux System LI-8100A (EQ013), which provide data on soil moisture, temperature, and soil respiration (soil CO 2 efflux), critical to understand belowground carbon dynamics.
- Eddy Covariance Systems: Utilize combinations of highfrequency gas analyzers (e.g., LI-6800 F - EQ011) and anemometers to calculate vertical fluxes of CO 2 , H 2 O, and energy. These systems are central to estimating net ecosystem exchange.
- Leaf-Level Gas Exchange Systems: The LI-6800 F (EQ011) and Leaf Porometer SC-1 (EQ018) allow in situ measurement of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration under varying CO 2 concentrations.
- Root Monitoring Systems: The Minirhizotron Camera BTC2 (EQ012) is used to monitor root dynamics noninvasively, providing images of root growth and turnover across treatment plots.
- Dendrometers and Forest Inventory Equipment: Instruments such as the Stand-Alone Logging Dendrometer DBL60 (EQ014) and Sap Flow Meter SFM1 (EQ015) monitor tree growth and plant water use through stem diameter and sap flow rate.
- Remote Sensing Platforms: UAVs with multispectral cameras and the Digital Emispherical Lens Camera Q25 (EQ001) provide structural and optical data on canopy conditions such as leaf area index (LAI), canopy openness, and light penetration.
- FACE Infrastructure: The CO 2 enrichment infrastructure integrates continuous monitoring of flow, pressure, and CO 2 concentrations. Gas analyzers such as LI-840A (EQ009) and EGM-4 (EQ017) are used to verify gas levels and atmospheric mixing.

To support traceability and metadata consistency, two summary tables are provided:

Figure 1: EQ004.

- Table 1: Instrument Metadata Summary - Lists the instrument codes (EQ001-EQ018), manufacturers, deployment locations, and the physical or biological processes each instrument targets.
- Table 2: Variable Mapping and Standards - Details the variables measured by each instrument, including a plain-language description, the standard variable name as defined by ARM/CF metadata conventions (using the standard_name attribute), and the units of measurement.

The use of standardized variable names such as surface_downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_a soil_carbon_dioxide_flux , and stomatal_conductance ensures compatibility with global data repositories and facilitates machine-readable metadata integration across platforms.

This structured and interoperable metadata model ensures that the AmazonFACE instrumentation network can support long-term ecological research with transparent and reusable datasets.

The project encompasses long-term ecological monitoring and experimental manipulation across temporal and spatial scales relevant to understanding forest-climate interactions in the Amazon biome.

Temporal coverage: Data collection began during the pretreatment baseline phase and continues through the full operational period of the FACE infrastructure. The datasets span multiple years and include:

- Continuous time series (e.g., micrometeorological and flux tower data) recorded at sub-hourly resolution;
- Historical environmental and climate data used for context and model calibration.
- Campaign-based measurements (e.g., leaf gas exchange, biomass inventories) collected seasonally or annually;

Spatial coverage: The experimental site is located in a primary tropical forest area near Manaus, Brazil, within the WRF

Georeferencing is applied to all spatial datasets, with coordinates recorded in decimal degrees (WGS84), and timestamps standardized to UTC.

tower site of the Brazilian Amazon. The spatial design includes:

- Multiple FACE experimental rings (treatment and control) with radii of 30 meters;
- Integration with regional-scale data from satellite imagery and atmospheric monitoring networks.
- Measurement points distributed vertically (from soil to canopy) and horizontally (within and outside FACE rings);

The combination of fine-resolution temporal data and spatial heterogeneity supports robust analyses of ecosystem responses to elevated CO 2 across scales.

## 3 Data Provenance

This section describes the origin, traceability, and handling of data collected throughout the AmazonFACE project. Documenting provenance ensures transparency, reproducibility, and scientific integrity by maintaining a clear record of how data were generated, processed, and curated.

Provenance documentation is essential for supporting scientific reproducibility and proper attribution of data sources.

## 3.1 Field Collection Methodology

Data collection in the AmazonFACE project follows standardized protocols developed for ecological and atmospheric monitoring in tropical forests. Field operations are designed to ensure consistency across time and space, while capturing the complexity of forest responses to elevated CO 2 .

Key aspects of the field methodology include:

- Deployment of meteorological and flux instruments on fixed towers located within and outside FACE rings;
- Periodic campaigns for biometric, physiological, and soil-related measurements following predefined sampling designs;
- Regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure accuracy and stability;
- Collection of metadata in the field, including instrument status, operator notes, and environmental conditions.

All field data are timestamped using UTC and annotated with ring identifiers, sensor positions, and depth or height levels when applicable.

## 3.2 Responsible Organizations and Personnel

The AmazonFACE project involves collaboration among multiple institutions. Responsibilities for data generation, validation, and curation are distributed as follows:

- Big Data Laboratory - Escola Politécnica, USP: Lead institution responsible for data curation workflows, provenance tracking, metadata generation, and repository submission.
- INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais): Provides expertise in metadata standardization and supports interoperability with national data infrastructure.
- AmazonFACE Coordination Team: Oversees field operations, defines experimental design, and coordinates logistics for data collection campaigns.
- Field Technicians and Researchers: Execute sampling protocols, maintain instruments, and record field-level observations essential to data validation.

Standardized protocols are crucial to ensure comparability between control and treatment plots over time.

Clear roles and attribution ensure accountability and proper credit for data generation and stewardship.

Each dataset includes contributor and institutional information as part of its metadata to ensure clear attribution.

## 3.3 Raw Data Storage Locations

Raw data collected from instruments and manual observations are stored and backed up in secured digital environments. The storage strategy includes:

- Local acquisition systems at the FACE site with redundant memory cards or onboard storage;
- Structured directory organization by ring, instrument, and date;
- Daily or weekly data transfers to remote servers maintained by USP and project partners;
- Preservation of original filenames, timestamps, and metadata headers for traceability.

Raw files are considered immutable and preserved in their original formats (e.g., CSV, binary, netCDF, or proprietary sensor outputs). Backups are maintained following institutional data management policies.

## 3.4 Preprocessing and Data Handling Tools

Preprocessing of raw data is performed prior to analysis and publication. The tools and procedures used include:

- DataLifePy : Python-based library developed by the Big Data Lab to automate loading, transformation, and documentation of sensor data;
- Standard Formats : Conversion of raw data to interoperable formats such as netCDF (Climate and Forecast conventions), with appropriate metadata;
- Custom Scripts and Notebooks : Developed for unit conversion, gap-filling, and QC flag generation;
- Version Control : Processed datasets are tracked using changelogs and semantic versioning to ensure reproducibility.

All transformations are logged, and derived datasets maintain links to their original sources to preserve full provenance records.

Redundant storage strategies protect against data loss and preserve the integrity of original observations.

All processing steps are traceable, allowing users to reconstruct how final datasets were derived.

## 4 Curation Workflow

The curation workflow defines the steps and procedures applied to raw data to ensure it meets standards of quality, usability, and long-term preservation. The Big Data group at Poli-USP follows a structured and transparent pipeline aligned with international data curation frameworks.

## 4.1 Ingestion and File Format Standardization

Fields marked with a red asterisk (*) are mandatory. Others may be optional depending on the specifics of each project.

## 4.1.1 Directory organization

[project]/[sss]/[inst_quali_temp_Fn]/[level]/[yyyy]/[filename].[ext]

1. /folder [sss] represents the site code component in directory names. It corresponds to a three-letter identifier ( sss ) that specifies the geographic or operational origin of the data. The code is assigned based on the site type, as detailed in Table 3.

| inst *      | Instrument identifier . Required code that represents the equipment or data product used in the field. This identifier may refer to a physical instrument (e.g., gas analyzer, meteorological sensor) or a Value-Added Product (VAP) derived from primary measurements. The code is typically an acronym describing the instrument suite, method, or processing approach. It should not end in a number unless the number is intended to enumerate multiple instruments or versions. Examples: gem5k for GEM 5000 (Landtec), mx6pid for MX6 iBrid with PID sensor (Industrial Scientific), or mwrret for a VAP that retrieves atmospheric profiles from microwave radiometer data.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| quali       | Optional configuration specifier . This optional component provides additional detail about the configuration, de- ployment condition, or processing method of the instrument or data product. It may refer to sensor types, installation specifics (e.g., depth level, height), operational mode, or derived processing. Common examples include a for shallow level measurements, b for deeper levels, avg for time-averaged data, comb for combined measurements from multi- ple sensors, and pid to indicate use of a Photoionization Detector. This field helps disambiguate similar datasets and enhances traceability in multi-sensor deployments.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| temp        | Optional temporal resolution . Specifies the time interval or granularity at which the data is recorded or aggregated. This component is optional and should include a numeric value followed by a unit abbreviation. Accepted units are: ns (nanosecond), us (microsecond), ms (millisecond), s (second), m (minute), h (hour), d (day), mo (month), and yr (year). For consistency and interpretability, we recommend using minutes as the default unit when possible, and avoiding inclusion of this field in the primary datastream name unless strictly necessary. Time durations should be simplified to the lowest practical unit (e.g., use 1m instead of 60s , and 1h instead of 60m ). Examples: 30s (30 seconds), 1m (1 minute), 1h (hourly), 1d (daily). Commonly used in PMG datasets from USP Leste to indicate sampling frequency or averaging period. |

3. /folder [dl] is a required component that specifies the data processing level in accordance with ARM data standards. It denotes the degree of transformation, calibration, and quality assurance applied to a dataset from its original raw format to a derived or aggregated product. The use of standardized processing levels promotes data transparency, reproducibility, and interoperability, supporting the implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles. Each level reflects a distinct stage in the data lifecycle, enabling users to assess data maturity and appropriateness for specific scientific analyses (see Table 5).
4. /folder [yyyy] is a required component that represents the four-digit year ( yyyy ) in which the data were acquired, generated, or processed. This temporal marker is essential for maintaining a clear, hierarchical structure in both file naming conventions and directory organization. Using a standardized four-digit year (e.g., 2024 ) ensures consistent temporal referencing, prevents ambiguities associated with twodigit year formats, and facilitates compatibility with international data management systems.

Table 5: ARM-standard data processing levels

| Level   | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 00      | Instrument-native raw data, typically in proprietary vendor format. No conversion, calibration, or preprocessing is applied. Intended primarily for archival or specialized reprocessing. |
| a0      | Data converted into interoperable formats (e.g., netCDF), retaining the raw measurements without calibration or quality screening. Serves as a transitional storage level.                |
| a1      | Data with geophysical units applied (e.g., ppm, %, µg/m³), post-calibration but prior to quality control. Represents an initial standardized dataset suitable for exploratory analysis.   |
| b1      | Calibrated data with integrated quality control flags, validated timestamps, and corrections for known issues. Suitable for rigorous scientific analysis and intercomparison.             |
| c1      | Value-Added Product (VAP): a dataset derived via scientific algorithms, data fusion, or model- ing techniques to extract additional parameters or correct observational uncertainties.    |
| s1      | Statistical or summary products, typically generated through temporal aggregation (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly averages). Used for reporting, trend analysis, or downstream synthesis.   |

Moreover, the inclusion of the year as a dedicated folder level serves a critical organizational function: it prevents directories from becoming overloaded with large numbers of files or subdirectories. In high-frequency or long-term monitoring systems, the absence of a temporal segmentation (e.g., by year) may result in thousands of files being stored in a single folder, significantly hindering file system performance, data discoverability, and ease of backup or transfer operations. By partitioning data into year-based subdirectories, the system enhances scalability, improves data access efficiency, and aligns with best practices for long-term data stewardship and archival. This is especially relevant for large-scale environmental datasets, observational campaigns, and multi-institutional repositories.

5. /file [filename].[ext] is the final component of the file path, representing the actual dataset file. This component includes the file name itself-typically composed of a structured sequence of metadata elements-and the file extension indicating the

## Example Filename

uspgem5kL1b1.20240415.v1.0.csv uspmx6pidL1a1.20240312.v0.9.xlsx maoecamzfaceM1c1.20150325.v2.1.nc

data format (e.g., .lal , .csv , .nc , .xlsx , .json ). The file name encapsulates key descriptors such as site, instrument, variable, date, processing level, and version, enabling users and systems to interpret the file contents without opening it.

The extension portion ( [ext] ) adheres to format-specific conventions and should reflect the file's encoding and structure, ensuring compatibility with analysis tools and archival systems.

In the next section 4.1.2, this component is examined in greater detail, with concrete examples illustrating naming conventions applied to environmental and atmospheric datasets within the Brazilian context.

## 4.1.2 Standardized Naming Conventions

Each file is named following a structured convention that encodes key metadata such as site, instrument, date, version, and format. The standard naming pattern is:

Raw Data Format:

[sss][inst][quali][temp][Fn].[dl].[date].[time].raw.[xxx].[ext]

Processed Data Format:

[sss][inst][quali][temp][Fn].[dl].[date].[time].[ext]

Compressed Data Format (TAR Bundles):

[sss][inst][quali][temp][Fn].[dl].[date].[time].[xxx].[zzz].[ext]

Table 6 summarizes the main file naming conventions, including formats for processed data, original instrument raw files, standardized raw datasets, and archive packages (TAR files)for both uniform and heterogeneous content. It also includes guidelines for auxiliary files such as documentation and logs.

Incoming data is systematically ingested into the curation environment using automated pipelines. Each dataset undergoes:

- Integrity checks (e.g., file completeness, timestamp verification, file size and structure);
- Conversion to standardized formats such as CSV or netCDF4 (following CF conventions);
- Assignment of unique dataset identifiers;
- Storage in organized directory trees grouped by site, date, and instrument.

Using interoperable formats like netCDF-4 enhances long-term accessibility and integration across systems.

## 4.2 Quality Assurance Procedures

A multi-level quality assurance (QA) process is applied to detect and flag data issues. This includes:

- Sensor validation using calibration metadata and manufacturer specifications;
- Application of quality control (QC) flags using standard coding (e.g., ARM or CF-style flags);
- Range checks, spike detection, and temporal consistency tests;
- Generation of QA summary reports for each dataset.

## 4.3 Data Cleaning and Transformation Steps

Following QA, data are cleaned and transformed as necessary for analysis and publication. Typical procedures include:

- Removal or interpolation of missing and erroneous values;
- Alignment of timestamps to a common standard (UTC);
- Unit conversions and resampling (e.g., hourly to daily averages);
- Merging of multiple data streams (e.g., combining meteorological and flux data).

## 4.4 Metadata Generation and Enrichment

Metadata are generated or enriched at each stage of the workflow to support dataset discovery, reuse, and citation. This includes:

- Descriptive metadata (title, abstract, keywords, contributors);
- Provenance metadata (processing history, software used, source file references);
- Technical metadata (instrument settings, sampling frequency, location, version);

Quality control flags help users assess data reliability and select subsets for specific applications.

All cleaning actions are logged to support reproducibility and user transparency.

Rich metadata enhances dataset discoverability, reuse, and alignment with FAIR principles.

- Compliance with metadata schemas such as DataCite, Dublin Core, and ISO 19115.

## 5 Metadata Standards

Data organization, discoverability, and long-term usability depend on consistent, well-documented file naming conventions and metadata. We follow a hybrid model inspired by ARM Data Standards, CF Conventions, and ISO metadata schemas.

## 5.1 Required and Optional Metadata Fields

Metadata are classified into required and optional fields to ensure both compliance and flexibility depending on the dataset type. Required fields are noted by red asterisks (*)

Table 7: Required and optional metadata fields.

| Field                                                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Required                              |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Data Set Title Data Product Date Issued Geographic Location Instrument Model Funding Agency License | Descriptive name of the dataset Responsible person or organization Date of publication or release Lat/lon of site or instrument Sensor/device used Organization funding data collection Usage and access rights | Yes Yes Yes Yes Optional Optional Yes |

## 5.2 Use of Global and Variable Attributes

For datasets stored in NetCDF or HDF5 formats, metadata are embedded as **global attributes** (dataset-level) and **variable attributes** (column-level). These include:

- Global attributes: title , institution , source , history , references , Conventions
- Variable attributes: long_name , units , standard_name , valid_range , missing_value

## 5.3 Application of ARM, CF Conventions and ISO Standards

Metadata and file structuring in AmazonFACE follow guidelines from:

Table 8: Example of NetCDF attributes.

|   # | Attribute Name   | Example Value                          | Level    |
|-----|------------------|----------------------------------------|----------|
|   1 | title            | Eddy Covariance Fluxes at AMZFACE      | Global   |
|   2 | institution      | Big Data Lab, Escola Politécnica - USP | Global   |
|   3 | long_name        | CO 2 Flux (30-min average) - -         | Variable |
|   4 | units            | µ molm 2 s 1                           | Variable |
|   5 | standard_name    | upward_air_co2_flux                    | Variable |

- ARMStandards: As outlined in DOE/SC-ARM-15-004 for variable naming, QC flags, and file content;
- ISO Standards: Especially ISO 19115 for geographic metadata and ISO 8601 for date/time formatting.
- CF Conventions: Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions for NetCDF, enabling model interoperability;

These standards ensure consistency, enable integration with global repositories, and enhance data longevity and usability.

## 6 FAIR Principles Implementation

The AmazonFACE data curation strategy is aligned with the FAIR Guiding Principles: ensuring that all datasets are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. These principles are applied throughout the data lifecycle - from field acquisition to public release.

This statement automatically references the figure below using its label: Figure 3.

## 6.1 Findability via Persistent Identifiers

To enhance dataset discoverability, all publicly released datasets are assigned **Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)** such as DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers).

Using harmonized standards ensures that AmazonFACE data can be discovered, interpreted, and reused by the broader climate and ecological research communities.

Figure 2: FAIR principles illustrated as a layered data pyramid.

## 6.2 Accessibility and Repository Policies

AmazonFACE datasets are deposited in open repositories with long-term preservation strategies.

## 6.3 Interoperability with Other Datasets

Semantic metadata and use of standard formats promote interoperability.

## 6.4 Reusability Through Licensing and Documentation

Documentation is released alongside datasets in both humanand machine-readable formats (e.g., README, JSON-LD).

FAIR implementation is monitored using checklists and semi-automated validation tools such as FAIRshake and F-UJI.

interoperability-flow.pdf

## 7 Versioning and Change Management

Effective version control ensures that datasets remain traceable, transparent, and reproducible across updates. In AmazonFACE, versioning is applied both to datasets and documentation, with systematic tracking of changes over time.

## 7.1 Versioning System and File History

Datasets are versioned using semantic versioning conventions:

v[MAJOR].[MINOR] (e.g., v1.0 , v1.1 , v2.0 )

- MAJOR: Structural changes that affect file content or layout (e.g., adding variables, format change).
- MINOR: Corrections, metadata enrichment, or nonbreaking updates (e.g., QC flags, units).

Version information is embedded in:

- File names (e.g., AMZFACE_PAR_20230401_lvl1_v1.2.csv )
- Repository versioning system (e.g., Zenodo, GitHub releases)

Each dataset is stored with a unique persistent identifier (DOI) tied to its specific version. Older versions remain accessible for transparency.

- Metadata fields (e.g., version , history , comment )

' Without versioning, data becomes a moving target impossible to cite, verify, or reproduce. '

-DataCite Best Practices, 2021

versioning-flowchart.pdf

Figure 5: Version control and data release workflow .

## 7.2 Changelog and Modification Logs

Every published dataset is accompanied by a structured changelog describing all modifications. This log includes:

- Version number and release date
- Author or curator responsible for the update
- Summary of changes (e.g., added variables, metadata updates, QA fixes)
- Reference to previous version

Table 9: Example of dataset changelog.

| Version   | Date        | Description of Changes                                                    |

| v1.2      | 2025-06- 18 | Converted file to netCDF format and added instrument calibration history. |

## 7.3 Criteria for Data Releases

AmazonFACE follows a staged release policy to balance scientific integrity with openness. A dataset is eligible for public release when the following criteria are met:

- All required metadata are complete and validated;
- Any embargo or publication restrictions have been cleared;
- Quality control and curation have been reviewed and approved;
- A license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) has been assigned;
- The dataset has been assigned a DOI and deposited in a trusted repository.

## 8 Publication and Distribution

The AmazonFACE project is committed to making its data publicly accessible, citable, and preserved for long-term scientific use. This section describes how datasets are deposited, licensed, and cited.

Pre-release versions may be shared within the consortium under restricted access with appropriate version tags (e.g., v0.9-beta ).
