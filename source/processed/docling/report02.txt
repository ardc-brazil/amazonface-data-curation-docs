## Appendix: Publication Timeline (Gantt Diagram) 10

## 1 Purpose and scope

This document defines the end-to-end governance workflow for bringing AmazonFACE datasets from collection to an institutional, publishable asset, aligned with ARM-style practices for standardized datastreams. It specifies (i) data product levels and quality expectations, (ii) the onboarding process from 'as-is' raw uploads to curated products, (iii) dataset entity rules (datastream boundaries), (iv) automation requirements for continuous streams, and (v) an implementation timeline for publishing the prioritized datasets.

## 1.1 Intended audience

- Data Mentors : domain scientists responsible for scientific interpretation and context.
- Project Management : coordinators responsible for prioritization, milestones, and sign-off.
- Curation Team : data engineers and curators responsible for automation, QC, and publication.

## 1.2 Out of scope

This document does not prescribe a specific repository technology (e.g., object storage versus POSIX) nor DOI registration mechanics. These are to be implemented according to institutional policy.

## 2 Key definitions

## 2.1 Dataset entity (datastream)

A Dataset (also referred to as a datastream ) is the primary publishable unit. A dataset entity must not mix different instruments; each instrument class or data product should be represented as a separate dataset entity (e.g., met for meteorology; co2flux for carbon flux).

## 2.2 Lifecycle states

- Legacy/Inactive : historical datasets that are static and not updated.
- Active : continuously updated datasets with scheduled ingestion and versioning.

## 3 Data product levels and quality expectations

AmazonFACE data products are organized into levels to clearly separate preservation, calibration, QC, and value-added processing:

## Level 00 (Raw Data)

Raw instrument output in its native format. Not intended for direct public use; preserved for provenance and auditing.

## Level a1 (Calibration / Engineering Units)

Data converted to a standard format (typically NetCDF), with calibration coefficients applied and represented in engineering units (e.g., C, m/s).

## Level b1 (Quality Controlled)

a1 products with automated quality-control checks and flags (e.g., min/max range tests, missing/invalid values, and delta/spike checks). This is typically the most appropriate communityfacing level for scientific reuse.

## Level c1 (Value-Added Products)

Derived products obtained from multi-instrument fusion and/or advanced algorithms that produce new geophysical variables.

## 3.1 QC principles for b1 products

The b1 level must preserve the original values while adding QC information (flags) whenever feasible. Core automated checks include:

- Range checks : enforce plausible minimum/maximum bounds.
- Delta checks : identification of abrupt changes (spikes/steps) inconsistent with expected dynamics.
- Missing/invalid detection : explicit flagging of missing or impossible values.

## 4 Roles and responsibilities

## 4.1 Data Mentor

The Data Mentor is the scientific point-of-contact for each dataset and is responsible for:

- answering scientific questions about the data (e.g., calibration status, meaning of specific fields);
- validating standardized naming, gaps, and access rules during the diagnostic meeting;
- providing acquisition context (location/plot/tower, period, sampling frequency, team);
- approving the final published documentation and QC behavior.

## 4.2 Curation team

The Curation Team is responsible for:

- maintaining the ingestion infrastructure ( /landing_zone , quarantine, archive, publication repository);
- converting to standard formats (a1) and implementing automated QC pipelines (b1);
- implementing parsing, integrity checks, and renaming rules for Level 00 preservation;
- generating and maintaining living documentation and changelogs;
- coordinating publication packaging and operational monitoring.

## 5 Data onboarding workflow

The onboarding workflow transforms an isolated dataset into a governed institutional asset with standards compliance from day zero.

## 5.1 Phase 1: identification and registration

Objective: establish ownership and context before any file movement.

1. Appoint a Data Mentor. The mentor is the focal point for scientific clarification and decisions.
2. Submit general metadata. The mentor completes an 'Intention to Submit Data' form capturing at minimum: instrument name, location (plot/tower), collection period, sampling frequency, and team involvement. These responses should populate documentation fields (e.g., authorship and acquisition details).

## 5.2 Phase 2: physical ingestion (transfer)

Objective: securely move raw files into the governance environment.

1. Upload to the landing zone. The mentor uploads raw native files to /landing_zone/[mentor_id]/ . Golden rule: do not rename or manually 'clean' files at this stage; preserve Level 00 as-is.
2. Automated sanity check. Upon arrival, the curation team runs a Python reader to verify file integrity (not corrupted) and confirm the format matches the declared instrument model.

## 5.3 Phase 3: joint curation handshake

Objective: align technical curation with scientific context.

1. Mandatory diagnostic meeting (Curation + Mentor). Agenda:
- Naming validation: the curation team proposes a standardized ARM-style dataset name; the mentor approves.
- Access policy: confirm embargo rules and license of use.
- Gap mapping: the mentor explains missing periods, maintenance windows, and known anomalies to be recorded in the changelog.

## 5.4 Phase 4: processing and publication

Objective: formalize the dataset in the catalog and repositories.

1. Standardization and movement. The curation team moves data from /landing_zone to the definitive archive (e.g., /archive/raw/ ), applying automated renaming for Level 00.
2. Generate documentation. The curation team produces the final README (and/or catalog metadata) using approved templates, including quality warnings and reader scripts.

## 6 Dataset publication model

## 6.1 Dataset naming convention

Each dataset entity must follow a consistent descriptive pattern:

## [PROJECT] [LOCATION] - [CONTENT] - [LEVEL] - [RESOLUTION] ([PERIOD])

Example:

AmazonFACE Plot 01 - Micrometeorology - Level a1 - 1 min (2015-2023)

## 6.2 Do not mix instruments

A dataset entity (datastream) must not combine different instruments. Create one entity per instrument class or product family (e.g., met , co2flux ).

## 7 Curation workflows by lifecycle state

## 7.1 Legacy / discontinued datasets (one-time curation)

Legacy datasets are static; curation is a single, definitive operation.

## · Technical preparation:

- -convert original files to the standard required format (typically NetCDF), harmonizing variable names and units;

- -apply retrospective QC when possible.
- Storage: upload the complete processed package to the dataset entity.
- Documentation: the README acts as a final report, including:
- -exact coverage period (start/end),
- -instrument description (including serial numbers),
- -reason for discontinuation,
- -summary of QC validations applied,
- -a banner indicating Status: Inactive/Legacy. These data are no longer updated.

## 7.2 Active datasets (continuous ingestion and versioning)

Active datasets require cyclical operations with explicit versioning.

- Processing pipeline:
- -ingestion of raw Level 00 data (automated collection where possible);
- -routine conversion to Level b1 with automated QC flags.
- Incremental upload: publish new files periodically (e.g., daily), without overwriting past files unless reprocessing is necessary to correct a known error.
- Living documentation: the README must be maintained as a living document with:
- -a changelog recording maintenance and configuration changes (e.g., 'Sensor replaced on 2023-10-15'),
- -an explicit status line (e.g., Status: Active. Update frequency: Daily ).

## 8 Automated curation pipeline

The curation pipeline must run on a secure server with minimal human intervention (except on failure). It is triggered when new files arrive from the field (e.g., via RaiDrive, SCP, FTP, or API).

## 8.1 Step 1: ingestion trigger (watchdog)

- Automatic action: monitor /landing_zone for new files.
- Task: detect new arrivals and prevent concurrent writes (avoid reading incomplete files).

## 8.2 Step 2: integrity validation (sanity check)

- Checksum verification (MD5/SHA): ensure transfer integrity.
- Failure behavior: move to /quarantine and notify the curation team (e-mail/alert).
- Structural validation: read header/first lines to confirm the file matches the expected datalogger/instrument schema.

## 8.3 Step 3: naming standardization

- Input example: data_logger_table1.dat
- Output pattern: amzf[instrument].00.[YYYYMMDD].[hhmmss].[ext]
- Processing: parse internal timestamp and site ID.
- Governance rationale: unique timestamps prevent accidental overwrites.

## 8.4 Step 4: metadata extraction (inventory)

Extract operational metadata without altering the data:

- coverage start/end,
- file size,
- record count,
- variable/column list.

These metadata should update the documentation fields (coverage window, changelog entries, inventory summaries).

## 8.5 Step 5: storage and backup (vault)

Move the accepted, renamed file to the authoritative storage map ('DataMap') and ensure backup policies are applied.

## 8.6 Operational execution schedule

Pipeline frequency must match acquisition patterns (Table 1).

Table 1: Recommended pipeline execution schedule by data type.

| Data type                                                                                       | Pipeline frequency              | Trigger                                                                                                                                         |
