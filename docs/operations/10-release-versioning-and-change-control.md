# Release, Versioning, and Change Control

## Release Objective

Publish datasets with reproducible versions, clear ownership, and machine/human-readable documentation.

## Versioning Policy

- MAJOR: structural or compatibility-impacting changes.
- MINOR: non-breaking enrichment/corrections.
- PATCH: localized fixes and documentation corrections.

## Release Readiness Criteria

- Required metadata completed and validated.
- QC behavior executed and documented.
- Licensing and citation defined.
- Repository/publication record prepared.

## Change-Control Workflow

1. Propose change and impact.
2. Review by curation + mentor.
3. Approve and execute release actions.
4. Record changelog and keep prior versions accessible.

## Publication Targets

Use trusted repositories with persistent identification and long-term preservation support, aligned with project policy.

## Source Basis

Versioning/release criteria from `report01.pdf`, publication/onboarding transition controls from `report02.pdf`.
