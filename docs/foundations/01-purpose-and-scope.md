# Purpose and Scope

## Purpose

This book defines the institutional data-curation standard for AmazonFACE datasets, from raw collection to publishable and citable products. It consolidates the curation/provenance report, governance/onboarding plan, and current dataset status inventory into one operational reference.

## Scope

The scope is the full data-curation lifecycle:

1. Dataset definition and registration.
2. Ingestion, integrity checks, and standardization.
3. Quality-controlled publication by data-product level.
4. Release governance, versioning, and operational monitoring.

## Intended Audience

- Data mentors (scientific owners of each dataset).
- Curation engineers and data curators.
- Project management and governance reviewers.
- Publication and repository operators.

## Book Logic (Linear Flow)

This book is intentionally linear:

1. Foundations: definitions, taxonomy, governance baseline.
2. Pipeline standards: onboarding, QC, cleaning, metadata.
3. Operations: monitoring, releases, incidents, continuous improvement.

## Source Basis

- `report01.pdf`: provenance, FAIR, metadata, publication and roles.
- `report02.pdf`: governance model, onboarding workflow, levels, automation.
- `report03.pdf`: current inventory/status of mapped datasets.
