# Governance and Compliance Standards

## Governance Objective

Convert isolated or heterogeneous datasets into governed institutional assets with explicit ownership, quality evidence, and publishable metadata.

## Core Roles

- Data Mentor: scientific authority, validates naming/gaps/access rules, approves final behavior.
- Curation Team: ingestion infrastructure, conversion, QC automation, metadata enrichment, publication packaging.
- Project Management: prioritization, milestone tracking, sign-off coordination.

## Mandatory Governance Controls

- No publication without dataset-level metadata completeness check.
- No quality-controlled release without QC evidence and flags policy.
- No release without documented version/changelog and approval record.

## Standards Baseline

- FAIR principles for findability/accessibility/interoperability/reusability.
- ARM-style datastream and file-organization practices.
- CF/ISO-aligned metadata conventions where applicable.

## Compliance Artifacts

Required artifact set per dataset:

- metadata record,
- processing/QC logs,
- release checklist,
- changelog,
- citation/license statement.

## Source Basis
