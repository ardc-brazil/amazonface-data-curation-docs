# Annotation and Labeling Standards

## Scope Note

AmazonFACE reports emphasize dataset curation/QC more than manual annotation protocols. This chapter adapts those principles into a labeling governance baseline.

## Labeling Governance Principles

- Use controlled vocabulary tied to dataset/entity definitions.
- Keep provenance of label revisions and responsible reviewer.
- Prevent silent overwrite of previous semantic decisions.

## Review Model

1. Primary labeling/classification.
2. Secondary review for inconsistencies or scientific ambiguity.
3. Resolution by mentor/curation decision when conflict persists.

## Minimum Label QA

- Range/plausibility checks where labels are numeric or ordinal.
- Missing/invalid marker policy.
- Change log for label schema or interpretation updates.

## Source Basis

Derived from QC, metadata, and governance controls in `report01.pdf` and `report02.pdf`.
