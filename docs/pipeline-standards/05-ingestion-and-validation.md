# Ingestion and Validation

## Ingestion Goal

Securely transfer source files into governance infrastructure and validate technical readiness before curation.

## Onboarding Phases (Ingestion-Focused)

- Phase 1: dataset identification + submit minimum contextual metadata.
- Phase 2: physical transfer into landing zone/quarantine/archive workflow.
- Phase 3: joint handshake to approve boundaries, naming, and gaps.

## Validation Layers

- Integrity checks: file readability, corruption detection, completeness.
- Structural checks: expected organization and format compatibility.
- Naming checks: standard pattern compliance.
- Metadata checks: minimum required fields and ownership information.

## Outcomes

- Accepted for curation pipeline.
- Returned for correction with reason and owner.
- Deferred pending mentor/governance clarification.

## Source Basis

Directly synthesized from onboarding and automated pipeline steps in `report02.pdf`, supported by storage/provenance sections of `report01.pdf`.
