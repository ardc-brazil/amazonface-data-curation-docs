# Quality Assurance and Acceptance Gates

## QA Objective

Define acceptance gates that determine if a dataset can progress from preservation to community-facing publication.

## Core QC Principles

For quality-controlled products (especially b1):

- preserve original values whenever feasible,
- attach QC flags,
- apply range, delta/spike, and missing/invalid checks.

## Acceptance Gate Sequence

1. Technical integrity gate (files, structure, naming).
2. Metadata gate (required fields and traceability).
3. QC gate (checks executed and evidence stored).
4. Governance gate (mentor and project sign-off).
5. Publication gate (license, citation, repository readiness).

## Minimum Deliverables Per Dataset

- standardized dataset package,
- metadata record,
- QC evidence/logs,
- release note/changelog,
- publication registration information.

## Source Basis

Direct synthesis from product-level/QC principles and deliverables in `report02.pdf`, reinforced by QA and release criteria in `report01.pdf`.
