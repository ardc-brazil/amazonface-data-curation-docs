# Pipeline Overview (E2E)

## End-to-End Objective

Move datasets from raw collection to institutionally published products with traceable provenance and repeatable quality behavior.

## Linear Pipeline

1. Identification and registration.
2. Physical ingestion to controlled landing zone.
3. Curation handshake (mentor + curation team).
4. Standardization to target product levels.
5. QC and metadata enrichment.
6. Publication packaging and release.

## Lifecycle Split

- Legacy datasets: one-time curation and publication.
- Active datasets: continuous automated ingestion + periodic releases.

## Core Pipeline Guarantees

- Provenance is preserved across transitions.
- Dataset boundaries (instrument/datastream) are respected.
- Quality decisions are evidence-backed and auditable.

## Source Basis

Mainly from onboarding/pipeline sections in `report02.pdf`, with provenance structure from `report01.pdf`.
