# Data Cleaning and Normalization

## Objective

Standardize heterogeneous source data into reproducible publishable products while preserving raw provenance.

## Required Cleaning Actions

- Resolve malformed or inconsistent field encodings.
- Harmonize units and value domains to target product-level rules.
- Flag missing/invalid values instead of destructive deletion.

## Normalization Targets

- File organization and naming conventions.
- Metadata structure aligned to standard fields.
- Machine-readable dataset descriptors for publication workflows.

## Provenance Rule

Level 00 raw data remains preserved; transformations into a1/b1/c1 are additive and documented.

## Source Basis

Synthesized from curation workflow, file-format standardization, metadata generation, and level model in `report01.pdf` and `report02.pdf`.
